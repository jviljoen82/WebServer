                <h3>Our Story begins</h3>
                <p>A band of 4 heros, Atineb, Jomoer, Chelly and Kripto.. set out in the world of Azeroth.<br>
                    At first things seemed easy, the group went about the business of eliminating the threats
                    in the Abbey of Northshire without much hassle.<br><br>

                    Marshal McBride then sent them to the forrest town of Elwynn, where our hero's quest would continue,
                    after speaking to the townsfolk and acquainting themselves with the town, our adventurers set out on their
                    first quest, to explore the mines of Fargo Deep... but little did they now...<br>
                    once in the mines the party had a rough time of it. The local kobolds soon overwhelmed them...<br><br>

                    After being beaten down, our heros in spirit form, went forth to try and retrieve their equipment,
                    but the kobolds thought it would be fun to play keep-away with our beaten adventurer's remains...<br><br>

                    A good struggle later then group managed to collect their remains and regrouped at the Elwynn Forest tavern,
                    to try to come up with a new plan on how to deal with this ...uhm... situation....<br><br><br>


                    to be continued....
